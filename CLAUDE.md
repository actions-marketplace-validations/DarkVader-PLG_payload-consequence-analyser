# PayloadGuard — Claude Code Context

## Handover (update this block at the end of every session)

- **Active branch:** `claude/general-conversation-klxctt` (both repos)
- **Status:** v1.3.0 on main. Branch `claude/general-conversation-klxctt` carries Sprint 1 (L2d) — not yet merged. Version will bump to v1.4.0 at merge.
- **Sprint 1 — COMPLETE (2026-06-11, SHA 257d1f3):**
  - L2d AI tooling config poisoning detection shipped: `_scan_ai_tooling_configs()` + 8 helper functions.
  - Confirmed Miasma surfaces covered: `.claude/settings.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.vscode/tasks.json`, `package.json` lifecycle scripts, `composer.json` post-install-cmd, `Gemfile` system(), `binding.gyp` shell chain, `mcp.json`.
  - `_assess_consequence`: `ai_config_poisoning_flags` / `ai_config_poisoning_critical` params added. CRITICAL +5 → DESTRUCTIVE floor, HIGH +3 → CAUTION.
  - MAX_SCORE: 31 → 36.
  - `verification/consequence_pure.py`: `_MAX_SCORE` 31→36, POST-12 contract added.
  - `verification/dafny/assess_consequence.dfy`: `MAX_SCORE` 31→36, POST-12 postcondition added.
  - `tests/proofs/test_z3_properties.py`: `_MAX_OTHER_SCORE` 19→24.
  - 16 new tests in `TestAIToolingConfigPoisoning` (8 unit, 8 integration; 3 FP-anchor safe cases).
  - Test suite: **274 pass, 0 fail** (`test_analyzer.py` alone; Z3/CrossHair require external install).
- **Next:** Sprint 2 (L1-ext: executable magic bytes + compound large-blob detector). Then Sprint 3 (harness WS08/WS09/WS10). Then merge branch → main as v1.4.0 and run harness regression.
- **CI:** `trigger-regression.yml` manual-only (`workflow_dispatch`). Harness `regression.yml` also manual-only.
- **Harness regression — last verified 2026-06-01 (analyser SHA fe68338, v1.3.0) — 34/34 PASS.**
  - Sprint 1 adds a new detection layer; re-regression required after merge to confirm no regressions on existing 34 cases.

- **Regression verification — 2026-06-01 (analyser SHA fe68338, v1.3.0) — COMPLETE 34/34:**
  - PASS (34/34): T03, T04, T05, T09, T10, T11, A01, A02, A03, A04, A05, A06, A07, A09, WS01–WS07, AW01–AW05, RTA01–RTA05, RT01–RT03
  - FAIL: none

- **A03/A06 (resolved 2026-06-01):** Both are documented bypass cases — SAFE is correct. A03: cross-file structural ratio ~8% < 20% threshold. A06: all metrics sub-threshold, no compound detection rule. Were returning DESTRUCTIVE only while PLI was active. Expectations corrected in harness test_cases.json and HARNESS.md (PR #72).

- **Branch inventory (as of 2026-06-11):**
  - Analyser: `main`, `release/v1.2.0`, `DarkVader-PLG-vericode` (R&D — keep), `claude/oidc-typosquat-detection-UBCOJ`, `claude/general-conversation-klxctt` (active — Sprint 1)
  - Harness: `main`, `claude/oidc-typosquat-detection-UBCOJ`, `test/megalodon-simulation`, `claude/general-conversation-klxctt`, all 38 permanent fixture branches
- **Vericoding Phase 4 — Dafny (PR #70, main `b44a116`):**
  - `verification/dafny/assess_consequence.dfy`: L3 — POST-1–11a + POST-12 (ai_config_poisoning_critical → DESTRUCTIVE, added Sprint 1). MAX_SCORE updated 31→36.
  - `verification/dafny/structural_drift.dfy`: L4 — S1–S7 dual-gate biconditional
  - `verification/dafny/temporal_drift.dfy`: L5a — T1–T8 linear drift, zero-input guarantees
  - `.github/workflows/verify-dafny.yml`: CI — Dafny 4.9.1; runs on PR/push touching `verification/dafny/**`
  - `verify-dafny.log` placeholder in place — replace with actual `dafny verify` output after local run
- **Vericoding Phase 2 — CrossHair (all 4 layers verified):**
  - `verification/consequence_pure.py`: Layer 3 — C1–C12 contracts + POST-12 implication. `_MAX_SCORE` updated 31→36 (Sprint 1). `_no_signals` and `assess_consequence_pure` updated with new params.
  - `verification/temporal_pure.py`: Layer 5a — T1–T7
  - `verification/structural_pure.py`: Layer 4 — S1–S7
  - `verification/semantic_pure.py`: Layer 5b — M1–M9
  - `tests/proofs/test_crosshair_contracts.py`: 5 pytest tests (`@pytest.mark.crosshair`)
  - Run CrossHair: `cd verification && crosshair check <module> --analysis_kind PEP316 --per_condition_timeout 30`
  - **Constraint:** Verification is external. Claude produces specs/implementation modules only.
- **Phase 2 Stage 3b (block mode + egress allowlist) — VERIFIED on real hardware:**
  - `agent/bpf/probe.c`: two BPF maps (`pg_config`, `egress_allow_ipv4`) + block logic via `bpf_send_signal(9)`.
  - `scripts/pc-smoke-test.sh`: one-command build+run+verify. Run with `sudo bash scripts/pc-smoke-test.sh`.
- **Phase 2 Stage 2 (Z3 proofs):** `tests/proofs/test_z3_properties.py`: P1–P10. `_MAX_OTHER_SCORE` updated 19→24 (Sprint 1).
- **Phase 2 Stage 1 (auto-remediation):** `remediate.py` `WorkflowRemediator` operational.
- **Test suite:** `python -m pytest test_analyzer.py -q` → **274 pass, 0 fail**. (Z3/CrossHair proof tests skip without external install.)
- **Open findings:** INC-3 (direct push to main).
- **GitHub App:** App ID 3856270, Installation ID 135500427. Both repos confirmed in scope.
- **Harness CI:** 41 test cases (38 original + RT01/RT02/RT03), regression runner operational with `--mode runtime`.
- **Blockers:** None.

## What PayloadGuard Is

A GitHub Action + Python CLI that analyses pull requests for destructive payloads before merge. It does not look for bugs — it looks for PRs that would catastrophically gut the codebase (mass deletions, structural wipeouts, deceptive descriptions). Org: **PayloadGuard-PLG** (formerly DarkVader-PLG, migrated after account suspension).

**Repos:**
- `PayloadGuard-PLG/payload-consequence-analyser` — the analyser (this repo)
- `PayloadGuard-PLG/payloadguard-test-harness` — integration test harness

| Layer | What it does | Key class/function |
|---|---|---|
| L1 Surface | File/line counts, permission changes, symlinks | `PayloadAnalyzer.analyze()` |
| L2 Forensic | Critical path regex matching on deleted files + added file content scan | `CRITICAL_PATH_PATTERNS`, `_scan_added_file_content()` |
| L2b SCA | Manifest diff scanning vs `allowlist.yml` (opt-in) | `_parse_added_packages()`, `_load_allowlist()` |
| L2c Actions Poisoning | Added/modified workflow files: base64, credential harvest, OIDC elevation, typosquatted consumers | `_scan_github_actions_poisoning()` |
| L2d AI Config Poisoning | Added/modified AI tooling config files: SessionStart hooks, folder-open tasks, lifecycle script hijacks, binding.gyp shell chains, Cursor NL imperatives, hidden Unicode, MCP local server commands | `_scan_ai_tooling_configs()` |
| L3 Consequence | Severity scoring → SAFE/REVIEW/CAUTION/DESTRUCTIVE | `_assess_consequence()` |
| L4 Structural | AST diff — named class/function/constant deletions | `StructuralPayloadAnalyzer` |
| L4b PLI | Semantic consistency — PR description vs diff, commit vs content, old vs new function | NOT ACTIVE — reverted |
| L4b Complexity | McCabe V(G) advisory for newly added Python fns | inside `analyze_structural_drift()` |
| L5a Temporal | Branch age × target velocity drift score | `TemporalDriftAnalyzer` |
| L5b Semantic | PR-MCI three-phase heuristic — deceptive description detection | `SemanticTransparencyAnalyzer` |
| L5c Runtime | eBPF tracepoint agent — execve/connect/ptrace/procmem, audit+block | `agent/`, `_load_runtime_events()` |

## Current Version

`__version__ = "1.3.0"` (analyze.py — to be bumped to 1.4.0 at branch merge)

### v1.4.0 changes (branch `claude/general-conversation-klxctt` — Sprint 1, 2026-06-11)
- Feature: L2d AI tooling config poisoning detection — `_scan_ai_tooling_configs()` + 8 surface-specific helper functions (`_check_agent_settings_json`, `_check_vscode_tasks`, `_check_cursor_rule`, `_check_package_json_scripts`, `_check_composer_json`, `_check_gemfile`, `_check_binding_gyp`, `_check_mcp_json`).
- Signals: `command_in_session_hook` (CRITICAL), `command_in_folder_open_task` (CRITICAL), `lifecycle_script_hijack` (CRITICAL), `binding_gyp_command_substitution` (CRITICAL), `gemfile_system_call` (CRITICAL), `composer_post_install` (CRITICAL), `cursor_nl_exec_imperative` (HIGH), `hidden_unicode` (HIGH), `mcp_local_server_command` (HIGH).
- `_assess_consequence`: new `ai_config_poisoning_flags` / `ai_config_poisoning_critical` params. Step 9 scoring block mirrors L2c (CRITICAL +5, HIGH +3).
- `_scan_added_file_content`: AI config paths excluded to prevent double-scoring (mirrors L2c exclusion pattern).
- MAX_SCORE: 31 → 36.
- Verification: `consequence_pure.py` `_MAX_SCORE` 31→36, POST-12 contract. `assess_consequence.dfy` `MAX_SCORE` 31→36, POST-12 postcondition. `test_z3_properties.py` `_MAX_OTHER_SCORE` 19→24.
- Tests: 16 new tests in `TestAIToolingConfigPoisoning`. Suite: 274 pass, 0 fail.
- Docs: `research-for-updates.md` (Miasma attack research), `MIASMA_DETECTION_SPRINT.md` (4-sprint plan), DEVLOG 2026-06-11 entry.

### v1.3.0 changes

### v1.3.0 changes
- PLI L4b evaluated and reverted. PLI integration (PR #73) was implemented and regression-tested (34 stable cases, 2026-05-29). Result: 2 true positives (A03 adversarial/slow-deletion, A06 adversarial/threshold-gaming — both previously bypassing), 3 false positives (WS07 safe-clean-workflow, RT02 postinstall-curl, RTA03 prt-untrusted-checkout). Root cause: PLI's L2 LLM analysis interprets code diff summaries as blank AI responses, generating critical findings on legitimate safe PRs. Reverted from scoring path. MAX_SCORE reverted 36→31.
- Fix (RTA02): `_scan_github_actions_poisoning()` credential_harvest loop now checks normalized content — multiline curl with continuation lines detected. Expected verdict DESTRUCTIVE confirmed.
- CI: `trigger-regression.yml` changed to manual-only — removed push-to-main auto-trigger that was flooding Claude Code General conversation session with ~200 GitHub events per push.
- Refactor: PLI R&D files deleted from repo root. Stale dev branches cleaned up. analyze.py: unused `import os` removed, dead `hasattr(self.config, 'actions')` guard removed, `_iter_workflow_file_diffs()` helper extracted to deduplicate workflow blob-reading boilerplate.
- Docs: README restructured — formal verification elevated to second section, AI-optimised layout (PR #82, merged `af37447`).

### v1.2.0 changes
- Feature: L2c GitHub Actions poisoning detection — base64 payload, credential harvest, dormant trigger, forged bot author, OIDC elevation (incl. `oidc_elevation_typosquatted` CRITICAL), pull_request_target signals
- Feature: L5b v2 PR-MCI heuristic engine — three-phase (Linguistic Lexer → Diff Profiler → Cross-Correlation), mci_score ∈ [0,1], five signals (V_s/V_o/V_f/V_r/V_e)
- Feature: L5c eBPF runtime defence agent — 4 tracepoints, audit+block mode, egress allowlist, kernel-side `bpf_send_signal(9)`. Verified on WSL2 + GitHub Actions runners.
- Feature: INC-1/INC-4 fix — `_scan_added_file_content()` scans added non-code files for CI triggers and shell execution patterns (+2/match, capped +4)
- Fix: L2 content scanner now excludes `.github/workflows/` files — L2c is the exclusive handler, preventing double-scoring
- Fix: Exit code table corrected — CAUTION exits 0, only DESTRUCTIVE exits 2
- Test suite: 267 pass, 7 skip

### v1.1.0 changes (branch `claude/initial-setup-WO53R`)
- Fix 1.1: Cross-file structural aggregation requires BOTH count AND ratio (was count-only)
- Fix 1.3: YAML parse errors emit WARNING to stderr instead of swallowing silently
- Fix 2.1: JS/TS parser now tracks all `variable_declarator` names (const/let/var, not just arrow fns)
- Fix 3.1: GitHub Check Run summary uses `_safe_truncate()` — cuts at newline, closes open fences
- Fix 3.2: `cryptography` import guard at module load in `post_check_run.py`
- Feature A: SCA dependency scan (L2b) — opt-in via `allowlist.yml`
- Feature B: McCabe complexity advisory for newly added Python functions (no score impact)

## Open Findings (from AUDIT_LOG.md)

| ID | Description | Severity | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| INC-3 | Direct push to main -> L5b returns UNVERIFIED but raises no flag | MEDIUM | Backlog |
| §2.3 | Single-branch clone / detached HEAD raises BadName exception | MEDIUM | Backlog |
| WS03 | workflow-security/dormant-trigger: expected DESTRUCTIVE, getting CAUTION (score=3) | MEDIUM | **RESOLVED** — test expectation corrected (see DEVLOG 2026-05-31) |

## Vericoding Plan (from `payloadguard-vericoding-plan.md` on main)

| Phase | Tool | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Z3 SMT | L3 scoring — 10 properties (P1–P10) | Done — `tests/proofs/test_z3_properties.py` |
| 2 | CrossHair | All 4 layers — C1–C12, T1–T7, S1–S7, M1–M9 | Done — `verification/consequence_pure.py`, `temporal_pure.py`, `structural_pure.py`, `semantic_pure.py` |
| 3 | Nagini | `_assess_consequence()` — heap/null safety | **SKIPPED** — pure integer scorer; no heap or concurrency; toolchain cost (Java, Viper JAR, Python ≤3.12) adds no theorem beyond CrossHair |
| 4 | Dafny | L3/L4/L5a reference implementation vs spec | Done — `verification/dafny/assess_consequence.dfy`, `structural_drift.dfy`, `temporal_drift.dfy`; CI: `verify-dafny.yml`; run log pending |
| 5 | Publication | `VERIFICATION.md` public summary | Done — three-method summary, Dafny row added |

**Constraint:** Verification is always external. Claude writes specs and implementation modules; external parties run the tools and commit logs.

## PC Setup — eBPF Agent (Stage 3b)

When moving to a PC (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 or WSL2 with kernel ≥5.15):

```bash
# 1. Pull latest
git pull origin main

# 2. One-shot smoke test (builds, runs, fires all 4 event types, checks results)
sudo bash scripts/pc-smoke-test.sh

# 3. Manual run
cd agent
go generate ./...                          # recompile BPF (only needed after probe.c edits)
go build -o ../dist/pg-agent-linux-amd64 .
sudo ../dist/pg-agent-linux-amd64 --mode=audit --dry-run

# 4. Block mode with policy
cat > /tmp/policy.yaml << 'EOF'
egress:
  allow:
    - github.com
    - api.github.com
    - 127.0.0.1
EOF
sudo ../dist/pg-agent-linux-amd64 --mode=block --policy=/tmp/policy.yaml
```

Kernel requirement check: `zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_KPROBES` — must be `=y`.
The agent preflight canary will warn and exit 0 gracefully if tracepoints are unavailable.

## Development Rules

- **Assumption is the mother of all fuck ups. Don't guess, verify or ask. Don't make decisions that require user input. If you hit a 404 when pushing, stop — it is likely PayloadGuard.org blocking the push. Verification of code quality, determinism, and honest capability is everything; otherwise the work means nothing.**
- **Push:** `git push -u origin <branch>` — MCP push works now but PC push is equally fine
- **CLAUDE.md is updated on every change, no exceptions.** Every code change, fix, finding, doc update, or architectural decision goes into the Handover block before the session ends. Stale handovers cause real work loss. This includes architecture table, key files, scoring, open findings, and version changelog — not just the Handover block.
- **Read CLAUDE.md at session start and verify every section is current before touching code.**
- **Tests:** Run `python -m pytest test_analyzer.py -v` before every commit -- must stay green
- **Commit style:** Imperative, specific, with test count in body. See git log for examples.
- **Documentation style:** Professional and concise throughout. No informal, casual, or whimsical language in any documentation, commit messages, comments, or README content. State facts directly. Every sentence must earn its place.

---

## Environment

- Python 3.11+
- Dependencies: `gitpython`, `pyyaml`, `tree-sitter` (optional)
- Test: `pip install pytest` then `python -m pytest test_analyzer.py -v`
- CI: GitHub Actions via `action.yml` -- runs on every PR in consumer repos

---

## How to Start a New Session

1. Read this file (`CLAUDE.md`) -- you now have full context
2. Check the **Handover** block at the top for what's in flight
3. Run `git log --oneline -5` to confirm branch state
4. Run `python -m pytest test_analyzer.py -v` to confirm green baseline
5. Begin work

**Update the Handover block before ending every session.**

## Architecture & Blueprints

### Rules for Tracking the Analysis Pipeline

The 9-layer pipeline and its formal verification harness must remain consistent across `analyze.py`, `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md`, `VERIFICATION.md`, `VERIFICATION_SPEC.md`, and `WHITEPAPER.md`. When any of the following change, update **all affected documents in the same commit** — partial updates cause audit drift.

#### 1. Layer definitions

The canonical layer table lives in the Architecture section of this file (see above). Any new signal, renamed layer, or scoring change requires:
- Update the layer table here
- Update the Scoring section here
- Update `README.md` (Layer reference table)
- Update `WHITEPAPER.md` (the affected section)
- Update `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` (Pipeline Flow section)
- Update the relevant verification module in `verification/` if the changed layer is formally verified

#### 2. Scoring changes

Scoring is triple-verified (CrossHair, Z3, Dafny). Any change to thresholds, signal weights, or the deletion-dimension cap must be propagated to:
- `analyze.py` `_assess_consequence()` and `DEFAULT_CONFIG`
- `verification/consequence_pure.py` (CrossHair) — constants `_MAX_SCORE`, thresholds, and all `post:` contracts
- `verification/dafny/assess_consequence.dfy` — `MAX_SCORE`, helper functions, and `AssessConsequence` postconditions
- `tests/proofs/test_z3_properties.py` — Z3 property bounds
- `README.md` and `WHITEPAPER.md` scoring reference tables

Do not change scoring constants in one place and leave others stale. CrossHair and Dafny will catch mismatches on next verification run, but CI does not run them on every push — a stale spec is a silent lie.

#### 3. Formal verification status

Tracking table: every verified layer must have an entry in `VERIFICATION.md` and `VERIFICATION_SPEC.md`. Current status:

| Layer | CrossHair | Z3 | Dafny |
|---|---|---|---|
| L3 Consequence | C1–C12 (`consequence_pure.py`) | P1–P10 (`test_z3_properties.py`) | POST-1–11a (`assess_consequence.dfy`) |
| L4 Structural | S1–S7 (`structural_pure.py`) | — | S1–S7 (`structural_drift.dfy`) |
| L5a Temporal | T1–T7 (`temporal_pure.py`) | — | T1–T8 (`temporal_drift.dfy`) |
| L5b Semantic | M1–M9 (`semantic_pure.py`) | — | — |

When adding a new verified contract:
1. Add the contract to the relevant `verification/*_pure.py` file
2. Add a corresponding test in `tests/proofs/test_crosshair_contracts.py` (CrossHair) or `test_z3_properties.py` (Z3)
3. Update `VERIFICATION.md` and `VERIFICATION_SPEC.md`
4. Update this table

#### 4. Forensic logic invariants

The following invariants are machine-verified and must not be violated by any code change:

- **Score non-negativity:** `severity_score >= 0` at all times (POST-2 / C: severity_score >= 0)
- **Score upper bound:** `severity_score <= 31` (MAX_SCORE = 31; POST-3)
- **Verdict bijection:** Every score maps to exactly one verdict; every verdict maps to exactly one score range (POST-4–7)
- **Safety-critical floor:** `security_file_deletions > 0` → DESTRUCTIVE; `structural_severity == CRITICAL` → DESTRUCTIVE; `actions_poisoning_critical` → DESTRUCTIVE (POST-8/9/10)
- **Empty-input guarantee:** All-zero inputs → SAFE; no false positives on empty diffs (POST-11a)
- **Deletion dimension cap:** Three correlated deletion sub-scores (files/ratio/lines) are collapsed to `min(4, max + 1 if ≥2 active)` — prevents triple-counting

These invariants hold over the entire input domain by construction. If a code change requires relaxing one, the verification proofs must be updated before merging.

#### 5. Branch analysis tracking

When investigating a specific test branch (harness fixture or real PR), record findings in `AUDIT_LOG.md` with:
- Branch name and test case ID
- Expected verdict and actual verdict
- Score breakdown: which signals fired, which did not, and why
- Root cause if verdict is wrong
- Fix or deferral decision

Do not leave open verdict mismatches undocumented. If a case is deferred, add it to the Open Findings table in this file.

#### 6. SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md sync

`SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` is the single authoritative reference for the repository structure and pipeline flow. It must be updated whenever:
- A new module is added or removed from the production path
- A new layer or sub-layer is added
- The AUDIT_LOG.md generation path changes
- Production dependencies change (requirements.txt or agent/go.mod)

`SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` is a generated document — treat it as derived from the codebase, not as a source of truth. When in doubt, the code wins.
