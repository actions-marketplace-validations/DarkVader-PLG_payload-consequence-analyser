verification/consequence_pure.py
================================
Pure-Python extraction of PayloadAnalyzer._assess_consequence() (Layer 3)
for CrossHair formal contract verification.

This module is NOT imported by production code. It is the verification target.
All contracts here are formally checked by CrossHair's Z3-backed engine.

Sync requirement: when scoring logic in analyze.py _assess_consequence changes,
this module must be updated to match. The contracts are the specification;
the implementation here must satisfy them.

Verification command (run from this directory):
    crosshair check consequence_pure --analysis_kind PEP316 \
        --per_condition_timeout 30 --max_uninteresting_iterations 10

Or targeting specific functions:
    crosshair check consequence_pure._compute_deletion_dim
    crosshair check consequence_pure.assess_consequence_pure

Expected result: exit code 0, no output (all contracts hold).
